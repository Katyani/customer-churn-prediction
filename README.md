#Predicting Customer Churn for Savings Accounts: A Data-Driven Approach to Enhance Customer Retention
In this project, the goal is to predict customer churn for a bank's savings account product by identifying customers at risk of maintaining balances below the minimum required. Using customer data such as age, gender, demographics, and transaction history, machine learning models are applied to assess each customer's likelihood of churn. The model provides insights into customer behavior, helping the bank take proactive measures to retain at-risk customers and improve overall customer satisfaction and retention.
